# Apple News Clone with React and Vite

This project is a clone of the Apple News app, recreated using React for the frontend interface and Vite as the build tool for a fast development experience. The app aims to replicate the core features of Apple News, presenting news articles in a user-friendly interface. Users can search for articles on various topics, read summaries, and access full articles. This project demonstrates the capabilities of React for building dynamic web applications and showcases Vite's efficient bundling and hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid development.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create the components and manage the state of the application.
- **Vite**: A build tool that offers a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite is used for bundling the app, providing HMR during development, and optimizing the production build.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. ESLint is configured to enforce code style and quality standards.
- **Babel** (with `@vitejs/plugin-react`): Used for compiling JSX and other modern JavaScript features down to code that can run in current browsers.
- **SWC** (with `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`): An alternative to Babel, providing fast compilation for modern JavaScript and JSX.

## Features

- Search functionality to explore articles on various topics (coming soon).
- Article summaries for quick browsing.
- Links to full articles for in-depth reading.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience across devices.
